# GDP Growth Prediction Using Macroeconomic Indicators

This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast **GDP growth** using key macroeconomic indicators obtained from the **World Bank Open Data repository**. The goal is to build a predictive model, analyze the importance of different indicators, and evaluate the model’s performance using standard regression metrics.

## Project Overview

GDP growth is one of the most important indicators of a country’s economic performance. Predicting it helps:

- Policymakers  
- Economists  
- Investors  
- Financial analysts  

This project uses and compares a **Random Forest Regressor** and **Ridge Regression** to predict GDP growth using features such as:

- Inflation indicators  
- Lending interest rates  
- Unemployment rates  
- Consumer prices  
- Other macroeconomic metrics  

The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
